# AbhiScript

AbhiScript is a hobby project of mine. It is a small programming language. This project is a Python interpreter for AbhiScript. You can look at the grammar for details on the language specification.

## Getting Started

To use this interpreter, you will need python 3. If you are on linux, Python can be installed from the python website or from your package manager for linux distributions.

Clone this repository to your computer and run the following command in a terminal:

```
python3 main.py
```
